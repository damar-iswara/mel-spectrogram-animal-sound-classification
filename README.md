# mel-spectrogram-animal-sound-classification
This project leverages deep learning to classify different animal species based on their acoustic signals. By transforming raw 1D audio waveforms into 2D Mel-Spectrogram images, the project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to effectively extract audio features and recognize distinct animal sound patterns with high accuracy.
